2827,"Memory of my partner and I tent camping at a state park last August in Michigan, US. We were camping just the two of us (our first trip together) and had become slightly intoxicated around the campfire after dinner.This was just after our 1st year anniversary of dating. It was still light outside and we had began to discuss aspects of our relationship together. My partner disclosed that although he had told me he was unsure he wanted to have children in the future, he actually decided he never wanted children. This cut me deeply as I very clearly communicated early on, as early as the third date, and even more so 2-3 months into dating, that not wanting to have children was a deal breaker for me.  That utter helplessness, feeling of betrayal and loss frequently will pop into my mind. My memory is how I felt in that moment, like my relationship was over, anger that he had kept this to himself instead of making this decision earlier on before I was so emotionally involved. I felt I had made sacrifices and changes in my life and plans in order to accommodate our future. I felt like this was an attack on me, saying that he really didn't want to be with me. I felt led on by him as he had casually mentioned ""If I had a kid..."" in certain situations and had not said anything to me when I discussed future children.",,"Memory of my partner and I tent camping at a state park last August in Michigan, US.
